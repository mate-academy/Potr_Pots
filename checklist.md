## Tech review

1. Add favicon, [example](http://joxi.ru/brRoByXuBJjwkm)
2. Add a smooth scroll for the whole page (`scroll-behavior: smooth;`)
3. Logo in the header and footer leads to the home section
4. The arrow "more about POTR POTS" should move down on hover and lead to `For whom` section
5. All interactive elements(**links, buttons, pictures, icons**) ***should have a hover effect and cursor pointer***. User must intuitively understand that he can interact with them
6. Make sure when you click on logo there is no 404 error (Use `href="#"` in `anchor tag`)
7. When you try to send the form there is no 405 error and the form is automatically cleared after submit and is scrolled to the top of the page or the page is reloaded
8. The form shouldn’t submit empty
9. After autocomplete the form, change the [default styles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52370890/146189569-ff5e5387-d2bc-4781-ab8d-fd507582512e.png). Read more about [changing autocomplete styles](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/change-autocomplete-styles-webkit-browsers/)

## HR review

1. To make it clear to the recruiter what exactly this landing page is, it is better to give the whole web page the title “POTR POTS”
2. A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma
3. Links in the header and menu should lead to the corresponding blocks of the landing page
4. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
5. Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the phone number
6. Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
7. After clicking the menu buttons, the landing page should scroll exactly to the beginning of the desired block (exactly where its section begins)
8. The user must have the opportunity to write 2-3 lines of text in the message field
9. The shopping cart button is clickable and leads to the feedback form
10. It is important that in the email field the user has the opportunity to enter the whole mail and the text is not cut off
11. All the social icons in the footer should be clickable and open the real social networks of the brand in a new tabb
