## Code Description and Features
This is alone page online shop of special ECO-friendly pots. It is not the hardest in the world project, but it is difficult notwithstanding. Here is non-standard logic that musted a developer to solve many geometrics tasks. So, there are 10 blocks:

**Header**
The header looks like the usual header, but it is not. There is a yellow trapeze on the background and there is one correlation of header indentation on all the screens.
*semantic (nav, ul, li) implemented
*UX logic (scroll and hide & show) implemented

**Main screen**
There are few blocks and with different right-side indentations and there are 'more about us' button that changes its positioning dependence of screen sizes. Also, there is a big yellow trapeze that implemented used divs only (without unnecessary graphics).
*There is in design idea to make text before picture, but it looks like a bug, and I decided to make it another.

**For whom**
This is the hardest one block because there is very unusual logic and it was really hard to set it in using usual instruments.
But I did it. Now it is equal to the designer idea (and I like it).
*There are few animated no-interactive elements.

**Only features**
This block was easy to implement but hard to animate. The designer didn't leave me gifs, I musted myself download them from the official Kickstarter page and then optimize them (gifs on the official site are 2mb> each)

**Team (about us)**
It is an almost easy block, but there are bit names before other elements and it requires absolute positioning, and it requires geometrical thinking when you adapt it for other screens.

**Materials and features**
This is a very interesting block because there are every dot dependent on its location. Doesn't matter which size of the screen it is.
*Also there are CSS animated popups
*Also there were not text hint in the design, so I went to Kickstarter and came up with it by myself.

**Size**
Really easy block, totally suitable for FlexBox or Grid using.

**Summary**
Almost easy block, but I wanted to make it "alive" and make different animations. The hardest one was to calculate dependencies of positions of cards. (Open DEMO on the wide screen and then hover the cursor on 'Buy now button')

**Contact us**
Block with form. Forms are made semantically correct.

**Footer**
Easiest block in this site

**Popup**
(By default it is hidden, touch any button to open it) There was not this block in design, but I love users and I make it for their sake. (Pots are really good, maybe you really want to buy it)
